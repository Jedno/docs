## What is Surf?

Surf is a very popular gamemode that comes from increasing sv_airaccelerate to give better air control. It quickly became one of the most popular gamemodes on games like cs:s, cs:go, team fortress 2 etc.

## History of Surf

## How Surf Works

Surfing on a ramp requires holding A on the right side of the ramp and D on the left, without holding W.
When boarding a ramp you need to look downwards, then slowly turn your camera until the bottom where you should be looking flat with the ramp.
If you want to jump off a ramp you need to slowly look towards it.
When you are mid-air its beneficial to strafe by holding A and turning left, then quickly switching to holding D and turning right then doing that motion again.

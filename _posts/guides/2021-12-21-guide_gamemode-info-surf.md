## How Surf Works

You can surf by holding A on the right side of the ramp and D on the left without holding W.
When getting on a ramp you need to look downwards, then slowly turn your camera until the bottom where you should be looking flat with the ramp.
If you want to jump you need to slowly start looking at the ramp and when you're halfway up look directly at it.
When you are mid-air its beneficial to strafe by looking left while holding A then switcing to looking right while holding D and repeating that.
